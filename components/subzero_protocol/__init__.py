"""
Pure C++ JSON parser for Sub-Zero / Wolf / Cove appliance BLE messages.

The parser is factored out of the YAML lambdas so its behavior can be
unit-tested on the host (see tests/cpp/). The lambdas in subzero_fridge.yaml,
subzero_dishwasher.yaml, and subzero_range.yaml call into this component
and publish the returned struct fields to ESPHome entities.
